<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<pre>
JavaScript is an open source & most popular client side scripting language supported by all browsers.
JavaScript can be run on any operating systems and almost all web browsers.

<h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language that is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage 
more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. 
JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and mobile application development.
Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced 
by the programming language C.

Run JavaScript
<b>
Being a scripting language, JavaScript cannot run on its own. In fact, the browser is responsible for running JavaScript code. 
When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it is up to the browser to execute it. 
</b>
All modern web browsers support JavaScript which runs on any operating system including Windows, Linux or Mac. 
Thus, JavaScript overcomes the main disadvantages of VBScript which is limited to just IE and Windows.

JavaScript Code
<b>
You should place all your JavaScript code within <script> tags (<script> and </script>) if you are keeping your JavaScript code within 
the HTML document itself.
Use the type attribute within the script tag and set its value to text/javascript:
</b>
<script type="text/javascript">
...
</script>


<h2>Using Variables in Javascript</h2>
<b>
Variables are used to store values (name = “John”) or expressions (sum = x + y). Declare variable before using the keyword var to declare a variable.
var name;
You can assign a value to the variable either while declaring the variable or after declaring the variable.
var name = "John";

or

var name;
name = "John";

Naming Variables
 variable names should start with a letter and they are case sensitive.
 </b>
 
<h2>Arrays in JavaScript</h2>
<b>
An array is an object that can store a collection of items. Arrays become really useful when you need to store large amounts of data of the same type.
You can access the items in an array by referring to its index number and the index of the first element of any array is zero.

Creating an Array
You can create and initalize an array in JavaScript:
 var students = ["John", "Ann", "Kevin"];
 Add more elements to the students array, 
 students[3] = "Emma";
students[4] = "Rose";

Also create an array using Array constructor
var students = new Array("John", "Ann", "Kevin");

or

var students = new Array();
 students[0] = "John";
 students[1] = "Ann";
 students[2] = "Kevin";
</b>

<b>
Properties and Methods
length property –> If you want to know the number of elements in an array, you can use the length property.
prototype property –> If you want to add new properties and methods, you can use the prototype property.
reverse method –> You can reverse the order of items in an array using reverse method.
sort method –> You can sort the items in an array using sort method.
pop method –> You can remove the last item of an array using pop method.
shift method –> You can remove the first item of an array using shift method.
</b>


<h2>Use Loops in Javascript</h2>
Loops are useful when you have to execute the same lines of code repeatedly, for a specific number of times or as long as a specific condition is true. 

There are mainly four types of loops in JavaScript.
for loop
for/in loop 
while loop
do…while loop


<h2>Use Conditional Statements in JavaScript</h2>
Conditional statements are used to decide the flow of execution based on different conditions. If a condition is true, you can perform 
one action and if the condition is false, you can perform another action.

There are mainly three types of conditional statements in JavaScript.
If statement:
Use If statement if you want to check only a specific condition.
If…Else statement:
 Use If….Else statement if you have to check two conditions and execute different set of codes.
If…Else If…Else statement:
 Use If….Else If….Else statement if you want to check more than two conditions.
 

<h2>Functions in JavaScript</h2>
<b>
 A function is a block of code including the repeated lines of code which will be executed only if it is called. 

Creating a Function
Use the keyword function followed by the name of the function.
Syntax:
function functionname()
 {
   lines of code to be executed
 }

Syntax:
function functionname(arg1, arg2)
 {
   lines of code to be executed
 }

Syntax:
function functionname(arg1, arg2)
 {
   lines of code to be executed
   return val1;
 }
</b>
 
 <h2>Cookies in JavaScript</h2>
 A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser.
 Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
 
 Relevance of Cookies
The communication between a web browser and server happens using a stateless protocol named HTTP. Stateless protocol treats each request independent. 
So, the server does not keep the data after sending it to the browser. But in many situations, the data will be required again. 
With cookies, the web browser will not have to communicate with the server each time the data is required. Instead, it can be fetched directly 
from the computer.

Create, Access and Remove Cookies
You can create cookies using document.cookie property
document.cookie = "cookiename=cookievalue"

You can even add expiry date to your cookie so that the particular cookie will be removed from the computer on the specified date. 
The expiry date should be set in the UTC/GMT format. 
<b>
If you do not set the expiry date, the cookie will be removed when the user closes the browser.
</b>

document.cookie = "cookiename=cookievalue; expires= Thu, 21 Aug 2014 20:00:00 UTC"
You can also set the domain and path to specify to which domain and to which directories in the specific domain the cookie belongs to. 
<b>By default, a cookie belongs to the page that sets the cookie.
</b>

document.cookie = "cookiename=cookievalue; expires= Thu, 21 Aug 2014 20:00:00 UTC; path=/ "
//create a cookie with domain to the current page and path to the entire domain.

You can access the cookie, return all the cookies saved for the current domain.

var x =  document.cookie
To delete a cookie, you just need to set the value of cookie to empty and set the value of expires to a passed date.

document.cookie = "cookiename= ; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT"

  
 
 <h2>Use DOM and Events in JavaScript</h2>
 <b>
 JavaScript can access all the elements in a webpage making use of Document Object Model (DOM). In fact, the web browser creates a DOM of the webpage 
 when the page is loaded. The DOM model is created as a tree of objects.
 Using DOM, JavaScript can perform multiple tasks. It can create new elements and attributes, change the existing elements and attributes and 
 even remove existing elements and attributes. JavaScript can also react to existing events and create new events in the page.

Common Methods and Properties
 1.getElementById:  To access elements and attributes whose id is set.
 2.innerHTML: To access the content of an element.
 3.getElementsByTagName: To access elements and attributes using tag name. This method will return an array of all the items with the same tag name.
 4.createElement:  To create new element
 5.removeChild: Remove an element
 6.You can add an event handler to a particular element
 </b>
	 document.getElementById(<em>id</em>).onclick=function()</p>
 
   {
 
   lines of code to be executed</p>
 
   }
or

document.getElementById(id).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, functionname)

 
 <h2>Object Oriented JavaScript</h2>
 <b>
 variables or arrays are not sufficient to simulate real life situations. JavaScript allows you to create objects that act like real life objects.
 You can create properties and methods to your objects.
 </b>
 
 You can create an object like this:

varobjName = new Object();
 
objName.property1 = value1;
 
objName.property2 = value2;
 
objName.method1 = function()
 
{
 
line of code
 
}

or

varobjName= {property1:value1, property2:value2, method1: function()
 
{ lines of code} };


Access Object Properties and Methods
objectname.propertyname;
objectname.methodname();


for/in loop
Syntax:

for (variablename in objectname)
 
{
 
lines of code to be executed
 
}
The for/in loop is usually used to loop through the properties of an object. 

 
 
 <h2>Internal & External JavaScript</h2>
 <b>
 You can use JavaScript code in two ways.
  internally within your HTML document 
   a separate external file and then point to that file from your HTML document.
   
   If you have only a few lines of code that is specific to a particular webpage, then it is better to keep your JavaScript code internally within 
   your HTML document.
   On the other hand, if your JavaScript code is used in many webpages, then you should consider keeping your code in a separate file. In that case, 
   if you wish to make some changes to your code, you just have to change only one file which make code maintenance easy in easy debugging. 
   
   
   External JavaScript
   Save the JavaScript code in a new file with the extension .js. Then, add a line of code in all your web pages to point to your .js file like this:

   Note: It is assumed that the .js file and all your web pages are in the same folder. If the .js file is in a different folder, you need to specify 
   the full path to your file in src attribute.
